## Roadmap for Improvements

- Redo the MainImage component, tear our pure-react-carousel and do it from scratch.
- Make the MainImage component pixel perfect
- Add enzyme/jest tests (at the very least smoke tests but also testing applicaple state and/or props ) 
- Do an audit of ARIA accessibility issues
- Do an audit for SEO issues
- Refactor components to abstract away more subcomponents to make the components shorter, potentially more readable, and probably more reusable
